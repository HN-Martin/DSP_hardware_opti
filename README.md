# DSP_hardware_opti

Using hardware specificities to optimize digital image processing on an external device (Texas Instruments TMS320 C6700 processor). 
These optimizations can not be performed by a compiler and make the program run 193 times faster.
The solution we found outperforms even classical asm software pipelining optimizing techniques.
